# """File that trigger `direnv` when entering a folder
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#   THIS SCRIPT CAN ONLY BE USED WITH 'direnv' PROGRAM
#
#   [Direnv](https://direnv.net/) is a tool allowing to automatically call a
#   specific script (.envrc) when entering or leaving a directory.
#   In short, once configured and allow, you will have no command to type, after
#   going to your working directory.
#
#   If you are using `direnv`, when entering a folder with this script, you
#   might see following error:
#   ```
#   direnv: error /path/to/.envrc is blocked. Run `direnv allow` to approve its
#   content
#   ```
#
#   # This means you have to review its content with your favorite editor (vim
#   here as example):
#   ```
#   vim .envrc
#   ```
#
#   # If you understand and agree to what is scripted in .envrc (as well as
#   invoked scripts from it), allow it for direnv:
#   ```
#   direnv allow
#   ```
#
#   And that is all, each time you will enter the directory where file
#   `.envrc` is, this script will automatically be loaded when entering it and
#   automatically unloaded when leaving it.
